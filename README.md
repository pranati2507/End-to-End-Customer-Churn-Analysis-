# 📊 End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis  
SQL | Power BI | Python | Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major business challenge where organizations lose customers over time.  
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end churn analysis pipeline**, starting from data cleaning to churn prediction using machine learning.

The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze customer behavior and churn patterns  
- Visualize insights using interactive dashboards  
- Build a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn  

This project is designed to be **portfolio-ready and evaluation-friendly**.
